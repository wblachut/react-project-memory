## Description

Web memory game. Cards images are based on Andrzej Sapkowski's The Witcher Saga's bestiary. Creating this web game focused on implementing functional components. I got ready page skeleton and changed it from class to functional component. I started to really like them since that time. I have also used hooks for the first time. Also finding all those slavic and other folk-beliefs beast was heck of a fun!

So hooks are a little bit complicated right? ...No! They are not, they are convenient!

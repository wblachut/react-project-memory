## Description

Web memory game. Cards images are based on Andrzej Sapkowski's The Witcher Saga's bestiary. Creating this web game focused on implementing functional components. I have got ready page skeleton and updated it to use functional component instead of class components. I started to rely more on functional one since that time. I have also used hooks for the first time which was really nice feeling. Also finding all those slavic and other folk-beliefs beast was heck of a fun!

So hooks are a little bit complicated right? ...No! They are not, they are convenient!
